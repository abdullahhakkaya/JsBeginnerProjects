# JavaScript Beginner Projects

This repository contains various simple web-based applications I developed during my JavaScript learning journey. Each project is designed to reinforce different concepts using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Purpose

This repository serves as a resource for those looking to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and DOM manipulation through practical applications. Each app is a small, self-contained project, highlighting specific JavaScript or web development concepts.

## Setup and Running

Running these projects on your local machine is straightforward:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    First, clone this repository to your computer:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/abdullahhakkaya/JsBeginnerProjects.git](https://github.com/abdullahhakkaya/JsBeginnerProjects.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Folder:**
    Go into the main directory of the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd JsBeginnerProjects
    ```

3.  **Open the Applications:**
    Each project resides in its own folder (e.g., `Calculator`, `CounterApp`, etc.). To run any application, simply navigate into its respective folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The easiest way to do this is by double-clicking the `index.html` file or, if using an editor like VS Code, using the "Open with Live Server" option (requires the Live Server extension).

## Applications

Below is a brief description of the applications included in this repository:

### 1. Calculator
* **Description:** A simple calculator application capable of performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). It processes user input for numbers and operators and displays the result.
* **Concepts Used:** DOM manipulation, functions, event listeners (implied by `onclick` in HTML), `eval()` function, error handling (`try...catch`).
* **Files:** `Calculator/index.html`, `Calculator/style.css`, `Calculator/scripts.js`

### 2. CounterApp (Counter Application)
* **Description:** A simple counter application with functionalities to increase, decrease, and reset a numerical count.
* **Concepts Used:** DOM manipulation, variables, functions, event listeners (`onclick`).
* **Files:** `CounterApp/index.html`, `CounterApp/style.css`, `CounterApp/scripts.js`

### 3. RandomNumGenerator (Random Number Generator)
* **Description:** A straightforward application that generates and displays a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1-6 like a dice roll) when a button is clicked.
* **Concepts Used:** DOM manipulation, `Math.random()`, `Math.floor()`, event listeners (`onclick`).
* **Files:** `RandomNumGenerator/index.html`, `RandomNumGenerator/style.css`, `RandomNumGenerator/scripts.js`

### 4. RockPaperScissors (Rock-Paper-Scissors Game)
* **Description:** An interactive game where the user can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. It displays the results (win, lose, tie).
* **Concepts Used:** DOM manipulation, random selection (`Math.random()`, `Math.floor()`), conditional statements (`if/else`, `switch`), functions, class list manipulation (`classList`).
* **Files:** `RockPaperScissors/index.html`, `RockPaperScissors/style.css`, `RockPaperScissors/scripts.js`

### 5. Stopwatch (Stopwatch Application)
* **Description:** A stopwatch application with start, stop, and reset functionalities. It displays the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
* **Concepts Used:** Timers (`setInterval`, `clearInterval`), `Date.now()`, time calculations, DOM manipulation, `padStart()` method.
* **Files:** `Stopwatch/index.html`, `Stopwatch/style.css`, `Stopwatch/scripts.js`

### 6. TemperatureConversionApp (Temperature Conversion Application)
* **Description:** A simple application that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
* **Concepts Used:** DOM manipulation, numerical conversions (`Number()`, `parseFloat()`), radio button input management, conditional statements.
* **Files:** `TemperatureConversionApp/index.html`, `TemperatureConversionApp/style.css`, `TemperatureConversionApp/scripts.js`
